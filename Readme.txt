This Graphical User Interface for the prediction of peak shear strength of H-shaped RC squat walls is developed by Zohaib Mehmood from Department of Computer Science, COMSATS University Islamabad with the help of Muhammad Saud Khan from Department of Civil Engineering, COMSATS University Islamabad and Department of Civil Engineering, Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology and Waleed Bin Inqiad from Department of Structural Engineering, National University of Sciences and Technology.

Here are some tips how we have developed the GUI.
1) Install python.
2) Install Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual studio code, Spyder, Anaconda, or Jupyter notebook which can run python.
3) Load code.

Tips to run code.
1) Open file in IDE.
2) Load file containing data and remove spaces containing no data.
3) load your GEP (Gene expression programming) parameters.
4) laod your XGBoost file.
5) Integrate.
6) Run.
7) Input data using scroll buttons.
8) Tap predict.
9) See Results
